Chi-squared test
----

[Pearson's chi-squared test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test) evaluates how likely it is that observed differences between sets of categorical data (what I think of as "segments") arose by chance. TODO: Fill in details.

The p-value is the probability that the sample mean difference between two compared groups would be the same or greater that the actual observed results if the null hypothesis were true. Higher p-value: More likely that the difference between groups are random.
